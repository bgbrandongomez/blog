## Blogs

* [Peyton's Blog][ClimbingRunningSeeking] is a blog about life with Jesus and how He is always there for you, even when you sometimes don't feel like it.
* [Austyn's Blog][SpreadTheTruthh] is a blog about spreading the truth about the Gospel and about the revival and healing of those who need the Gospel.
  * Austyn has a second blog at [Odyssey Online][OdysseyBlog] now. I had to create a [rss feed][OdysseyBlogRSS] for the blog as [Odyssey Online](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/) does not have its own feeds for its authors yet.
