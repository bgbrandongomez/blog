/* The whole point of this file is to allow me to use the Github API in order to perform authentication when editing blog posts on my 
 * website. After performing authentication, I will have my own Javascript editor to make changes to my site live before pushing to 
 * Github. If I set the Javascript correctly, I can also build an on phone editor on both the website and app that will allow me to 
 * edit my posts on the fly. The main reason for doing this is so I can visually see what posts in the _drafts folder look like instead 
 * of it just being a mental image or having to wait until I get home.
