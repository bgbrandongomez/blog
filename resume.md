This resume below is a combination of several resumes I have used in the past. I have removed most identifying information such as my address and replaced it with psuedo-html tags. The h1 and h3 tags are there to remind me where I need to bold the text if I decide to use this copy of the resume instead of the copy on Google Drive. Some sections such as Skills are modified depending on where I am applying. For example, I only used "Creative Thinking", "Task Organization", and "Can Identify Problems and Solve Them" when I applied for Twisted Taco at my university.
