### Decisions, Decisions

So, for the last post, [Music Artistry][music-artistry], I mentioned that services such as Google, Amazon, and other stores merge the three or more track files down to two tracks. Earlier today, I was messing around with Patreon to see if I could keep the tracks I wanted to while hosting with Patreon. I found out that Patreon does not accept flac files when uploaded as an audio file type, so I went into Audacity and converted the file over to mp3. Turns out, the format itself (at least according to Audacity) does not support more than 2 tracks. I jumped the gun on that one not realizing the format just simply did not support more than two tracks.

Now, what that means is, I will have to release all my audio in flac format, or at least a format that supports more than 2 tracks. Now, I am using flac because I have no license royalties to worry about when using this format (and because of the issue with the tracks).

As for how I decided to release any tracks I make, I will using Patreon to sell my tracks. How this works is that I release the tracks as a post and Patreon will charge for every post that I charge for. That content is then available to anyone who wants to download it, providing that they are a Patreon. I can then do something such as release a 30 second version for anyone who wants to listen to that and decide if they would like it. The 30 seconds is not exactly like a low-res image to the full quality, but it should do for now.

As for those who want to listen to the full song, but don't exactly want to pay for it (whether just in the moment or at all), I am going to continue to use Distrokid to publish to Spotify and other streaming services and I will also publish the song on SoundCloud.

Now, I still need to figure out where I can sell the songs without having it converted to mp3 or otherwise changed in a way I don't like so people don't have to worry about paying for music they wouldn't listen to. If you just liked one song by me, but hated all the rest, would you really want to pay for all of them just to get that one song? I would not, so, I am still on the search for a store that won't change my music.

### Legal Rights

I have actually taken screenshots of the terms of services for the different services I currently use and will post them here so if someone argues that I gave up copyright, I can say, nope! Here is listed the TOS for [SoundCloud][soundcloud-tos], [Patreon][patreon-tos], [Github][github-tos], and [Distrokid][distrokid-tos]!

As for Github, I also wanted to mention that my posting these blog posts here is still considered a personal project and not commercial because I use this blog to talk about my projects and what I enjoy doing in my life. Any actual selling or commercial work is only referenced and linked to by this [blog](/), and I do not have anything such as a payment form on these pages (for any commercial use, donations, maybe, but donations are still allowed). The only commercial I create listed here are links to outside services and not on this site itself. The part of the terms that talks about this is [here][github-tos-advert].
