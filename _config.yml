permalink: /:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title #Beware that jekyll does count the number of spaces before permalink: and all other variables. Adding spaces either makes a Forbidden message show up as jekyll thinks that permalink: is part of the values: category or will make Jekyll use the default permalink instead without throwing any errors.
